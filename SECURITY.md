# Reporting Security Issues

Our Team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to disclose your findings responsibly and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/soysoliscarlos/terraform-azurerm-ADDC/security/advisories/new) tab.

Our team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress toward a fix and full announcement and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.
